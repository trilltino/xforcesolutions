            <h2>The Trading Terminal</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">
                The terminal is the heart of the system - it's what you interact with. Think of it as having three main parts: 
                the beautiful desktop app you see, the backend server that does the heavy lifting, and a web helper for connecting wallets.
            </p>

            <div class="why-matters">
                <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                <p>
                    Most trading tools are web-based, which means they're slower and less secure. By building a native desktop app, 
                    we get Bloomberg-terminal-level performance. Your private keys never leave your computer, and everything happens 
                    instantly. Plus, the modular design means other developers can reuse our code to build their own tools.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>System Architecture Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The trading terminal consists of three main components that work together seamlessly, supported by reusable libraries 
                and a local database. Here's how everything connects:
            </p>

            <div class="plain-english" style="margin: 30px 0;">
                <h4>Component Interaction Flow</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Desktop App</strong> sends requests to <strong>Backend Server</strong> when you want to trade or check prices. 
                    The <strong>Backend Server</strong> uses the helper libraries to communicate with the blockchain, process data, and manage 
                    authentication. The <strong>Web Wallet Helper</strong> runs in your browser to securely connect external wallets like Phantom 
                    or Solflare. All components share reusable libraries (<code>lib-solana</code>, <code>lib-core</code>, <code>lib-web</code>, 
                    <code>lib-auth</code>) and store data in a <strong>Local SQLite Database</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Three Main Parts</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Desktop App (What You See)</h4>
            <p>
                This is the beautiful Bloomberg-style interface that runs on your computer. It shows you real-time prices, 
                lets you make trades, displays charts, and keeps track of your portfolio. It's built with Rust for maximum 
                speed and security.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Shows you everything in a professional trading interface</li>
                <li><strong>Why it's special:</strong> Native desktop app means it's super fast - updates happen in less than 50 milliseconds</li>
                <li><strong>Where it lives:</strong> <span class="code-ref">terminal/</span> folder</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Backend Server (The Worker)</h4>
            <p>
                This is the server that runs in the background. When you click "swap tokens" in the desktop app, it's the backend 
                that talks to Jupiter to find the best price, builds the transaction, and sends it to Solana. It also stores 
                your trading history and handles authentication.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Handles all the complex work behind the scenes</li>
                <li><strong>Why it's special:</strong> Built with Axum (a super fast Rust web framework) - can handle thousands of requests per second</li>
                <li><strong>Where it lives:</strong> <span class="code-ref">backend/</span> folder, runs on port 3001</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Web Wallet Helper (Browser Tool)</h4>
            <p>
                This is a small web app that helps you connect popular wallets like Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack. It runs in 
                your browser and makes it easy to link your existing wallet to the terminal.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Makes wallet connection simple and secure</li>
                <li><strong>Why it's special:</strong> Works with all major Solana wallets</li>
                <li><strong>Where it lives:</strong> <span class="code-ref">wallet-web/</span> folder</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Helper Libraries</h3>
            <p>
                These are reusable code packages that make everything work. Think of them as toolboxes - each one has specific 
                tools for specific jobs.
            </p>
