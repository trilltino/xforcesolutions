## About Me

I'm a **Rust-first** software engineer specializing in building **idiomatic, production-grade** systems and applications. My work emphasizes performance, memory safety, and type safety across the entire stack—from blockchain smart contracts to full-stack web applications and native desktop software.

I believe in writing code that not only works but exemplifies best practices, demonstrating what's possible when leveraging Rust's unique strengths in systems programming, web development, and blockchain technology.

## Leadership & Community

### President, European Chapter — Stellar Development Foundation Ambassador Program

I had the honor of serving as **President of the European Chapter of the Stellar Development Foundation's Ambassador Program**, where I led initiatives to advance blockchain technology adoption and developer education across Europe. This role provided me with invaluable opportunities to:

- **Employ cutting-edge technology** in production environments
- **Discuss and evangelize** blockchain technology and developer best practices
- **Mentor and guide** the next generation of blockchain developers
- **Bridge the gap** between technical implementation and strategic vision

This leadership experience has deepened my understanding of how technology can drive real-world impact while maintaining the highest standards of code quality and architectural excellence.

## Development Philosophy

I write **idiomatic, production-grade Rust code** that:

- Emphasizes **type safety** and **memory safety** at compile time
- Follows **Rust best practices** and established patterns
- Implements **comprehensive error handling** and logging
- Includes **production-ready documentation** and code comments
- Designs **modular, reusable architectures** suitable for open-source contribution
- Prioritizes **performance** without sacrificing code clarity
- Demonstrates **real-world applicability** in production environments

## Featured Project Highlight

### XForce Terminal — End-to-End Rust DeFi Platform

XForce Terminal represents the pinnacle of idiomatic Rust development—a complete full-stack application built entirely in Rust from smart contracts to desktop GUI to web components. The project showcases:

- **Unified Type Safety:** Shared types across Solana programs, desktop app, backend API, and web components
- **Production Architecture:** Modular libraries (`lib-solana`, `lib-core`, `lib-web`, `lib-auth`) designed for crates.io publication
- **Advanced Patterns:** CRDT-based messaging with Braid Protocol, AI integration with rust-genai, and comprehensive REST API
- **Developer Infrastructure:** Extensible plugin architecture and open-source patterns for ecosystem contribution

This project exemplifies my commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Rust while maintaining the highest standards of code quality and architectural design.
